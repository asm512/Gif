### An application for extracting Gifs into native image formats

![Alt text](/demo.PNG?raw=true "Demo Image")

#### Notes

-Function to extract frames comes can be taken easier from my gists, (link in profile)
-Please remember this isn't finished, but basic functions work as long as there are no input inconsistencies, this relies on external files, and at the moment, any extract path that isn't the default or custom one is unlikely to work
-Items don't get removed from combobox after selecting a new gif 


#### Things I'd like to add
-Set of native image formats to png
-More image formats (ico and BMP)
