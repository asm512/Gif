#### Notes

-Function to extract frames comes can be taken easier from my gists, (link in profile)

-Please remember this isn't finished, but basic functions work as long as there are no input inconsistencies, this relies on external 
files, and at the moment, any extract path that isn't the default or custom one is unlikely to work

-Items don't get removed from combobox after selecting a new gif 

-To use this, build it yourself (reccomended), or use the releases tab, however I won't update the releases tab for every minor fix, so I'd reccomend building the soloution yourself 


#### Things I'd like to add
-Set of native image formats to png
-More image formats (ico and BMP)

    
#### Libraries and classes used
-For visual design - MahApps (metro)
-For INI parsing and reading 
- easyINI (can be found under my repositories)
